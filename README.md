# UsabilityTest
A Comparative Study to evaluate the usability of the two statistic programs SPSS and JASP.

In a university project we compared two different softwares for statistic analysis regarding their usability. We first conducted the KeyStroke-Level-Model and heuristic evaluations according to Nielsen's 10 Heuristics for UI Design.

Our hypothesis was that JASP would be more effective, efficient and satisfying than SPSS.

After that, we tested the results in a survey with 25 participants, measuring effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction with quantitative and qualitative data. The participants solved three different tasks with both softwares.

Effectiveness:
- number of correct solved tasks
- number of incorrect clicks

Efficiency:
- SMEQ
- Number of clicks
- Time for solving a task

Satisfaction:
- QUESI questionnaire
- AttrakDiff questionnaire
- qualitative Data

Our results showed that regarding 
- effectiveness: SPSS was better than JASP
- efficiency: no software was better
- satisfaction: JASP was better than SPSS
